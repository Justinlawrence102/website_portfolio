				<h2>Ryerson Invitational Thrill Design Competition</h2>
				<h3 style="text-align:center;">Overall First Place Winner</h3>
                <p>I had the opertunity to complete on the University of Florida's team in the 2018 RITDC comeption. We were given 3 days to complete five different challanges, and present a 15 minute presentation for each of the challenges throughout the weekend. I was involved in creating 3D models for a 3D rendering of a roller coaster attraction using SketchUp. I created a story for an original attraction, and with the help from a couple of my teammates, created story boards to display how each of the show scenes would look for the guests. Finally, I created ASM diagrams to show how the safety systems of an attraction would run.</p>
                <p> One of the most valuable aspects of the competition was the ability to present our concepts to industry professionals, revieve their feedback, and answer their questions. The question and answer portion of the presentations were the most challenging becasue we did no know what we might be asked, but still had to provide an acceptable answer. </p>
                <p> Our team preformed very well in the competition. We came first place in the roller coaster design challange and mechanincal engineering design challenge, second place in the attraction design challenge, and came in first place overall. This was a incredible opertunity to get to work on real-world challenges and present our ideas to people who work in the Themed Entertainemnt industry.</p>
